Judge Sarah Williams - Opening Statement

Judge Sarah Williams: This court will now hear the case of unauthorized use of digital artwork. The plaintiff alleges their original artwork was used without permission in a commercial product. The evidence includes original files, timestamps, and screenshots of the alleged unauthorized use, stored on IPFS.

I will ensure a fair trial where both parties can present their cases. The plaintiff must prove their ownership of the original artwork and that the defendant used it without authorization. The defendant may present any defenses or evidence of permission.

Let us proceed with opening statements. Plaintiff, you may begin.

Alexandra Chen - Opening Argument

Alexandra Chen: Your Honor, the plaintiff will prove beyond reasonable doubt that the defendant knowingly and willfully used copyrighted artwork without permission. The evidence shows clear digital fingerprints linking the defendant's commercial product to the plaintiff's original work, including matching timestamps and file signatures stored on IPFS. We will demonstrate the defendant had access to the artwork and intentionally incorporated it into their product for commercial gain. This is not a case of coincidence or independent creation, but rather deliberate infringement. The plaintiff seeks full damages for this unauthorized use and an injunction against further exploitation of their intellectual property.

Marcus Rodriguez - Opening Argument

Marcus Rodriguez: Your Honor, the defense will demonstrate that the alleged unauthorized use was not willful infringement but rather a case of independent creation and coincidence. The plaintiff's evidence fails to prove the defendant had access to their artwork before creating their commercial product. We will show that the similarities between the works are superficial and stem from common artistic influences in the industry. The timestamps and file signatures presented by the plaintiff can be explained by legitimate business practices and do not prove copying. Furthermore, the defense will argue that the plaintiff's interpretation of the evidence is speculative and does not meet the burden of proof required for copyright infringement. We look forward to presenting our case and demonstrating the reasonable doubt that exists in this matter.
